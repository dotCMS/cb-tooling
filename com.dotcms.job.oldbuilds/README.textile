This plugin register a quartz job that deletes assets for old nightly builds
http://dotcms.com/download/nightly.dot
It doesn't touch the contentlet. Just its assets.
It searches for nightly builds older than 40 days but no more than 60 days old. Those 
older than that should got the axe in past runs.
By default it is running once a day at 01:00am.
